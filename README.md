🚀 IvE Design Challenge – Offline Information Management System (OIMS)
📌 Project Overview

Building an Offline Information Management System (OIMS) for the Kenyatta University Design Studio, with integrated links to the Cezeri Lab and MedTech Lab. This system will streamline user management, inventory tracking, project coordination, and workspace booking while ensuring offline data availability and security.

This project is part of the IvE Design Challenge, where the best implementations will be showcased and rewarded.
🎯 Features & Functionalities
🔑 User Management

    Role-Based Access Control:
        🛠 Admin: Full system control
        🏗 Technicians: Manage inventory & equipment logs
        🎓 Students: Limited access for projects & resource booking
        🔬 Lab Managers (IvE, Cezeri & MedTech): Cross-lab functionalities
    Authentication & Profiles: Secure login & role-specific dashboards

🏷 Inventory Management

    📋 Equipment & Tools Tracking: Availability status (in use, available, maintenance)
    🔍 Unique Identification: Barcode/QR codes for each item
    🛠 Maintenance Scheduling: Automated reminders, logs, and history
    🔗 Asset Sharing: Track shared equipment across labs

📂 Project Management

    📌 Project Tracking: View active, pending, and completed projects
    🏗 Resource Allocation: Schedule/reserve equipment & workspaces, prevent conflicts
    📑 Documentation Management: Store project files, reports & diagrams offline

📅 Workspace & Equipment Booking

    📆 Booking System: Reserve machines, equipment, and lab spaces
    ⏳ Time Slot Allocation: Prevent overbooking
    📜 Usage Logs: Track who used what, when, and for how long

🔗 Integration with Cezeri Lab & MedTech Lab

    🔄 Shared Inventory Management: Cross-lab visibility of tools & equipment
    🔁 Offline Data Syncing: Automatic updates when connected to a local server

🔒 Backup & Data Security

    💾 Offline Data Storage: Keep data on local servers
    🔄 Automated Backups: Restore options included
